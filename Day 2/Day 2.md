🐳 Day 2 | Docker Architecture | A Coffee Shop Analogy ☕

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

To truly leverage Docker, it’s essential to understand its client–server architecture. Let’s simplify it with 📸 Attached diagrams for better understanding:

 1️⃣ Coffee Shop Analogy for Docker Architecture ☕
 2️⃣ Technical Docker Architecture Diagram 🐳

🧩 Key Components of Docker Architecture
🔹 Docker Daemon → Listens for API requests & manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.
 🔹 Docker Client → The CLI tool (docker run, docker build) that interacts with the daemon.
 🔹 Docker Registries → Store Docker images (public/private)
 🔹 Docker Desktop → A packaged solution for Windows, macOS, &Linux that includes the daemon, client, Docker Compose etc.

✅ Key Takeaway
Docker uses a client–server model where the client requests are executed by the daemon . This separation ensures efficiency, scalability, and portability across environments.
