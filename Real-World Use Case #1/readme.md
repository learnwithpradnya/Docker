## 🧩 What I Built

✅ **Step 1 – Dockerized a Custom Nginx App**  
- Used `nginx:alpine` as the base image
- Added a custom `index.html` page with app details  
- Configured a `HEALTHCHECK` to monitor container status  

✅ **Step 2 – Automated Deployment with Terraform**  
- Defined `provider` and `docker_container` resource blocks  
- Executed terraform workflow (Terraform init , terraform plan and terraform apply)

✅ **Step 3 – Verified & Monitored Health**  
- Execute `docker ps` to confirm the container is running  
- Verified container health status and app response
